        <h2>Get to know Briley</h2>
        <p>Hi! I’m Briley, and I’ve always loved being the host! I think one of the greatest things we can do is to
            gather and celebrate. In my opinion, no matter the occasion there is always joy to be found when you bring
            people together. </p>
        <p>I’ve learned that hosting can be a lot though - between decorations, food, and making sure everyone’s having
            fun, it’s easy to forget to actually enjoy your own event! That’s why I created this site — to share simple,
            stress-free ways to plan parties, girls’ nights, birthdays, and more, so you can be the host who actually
            gets to relax and have fun, too.</p>
        <h2>What's my experience?</h2>
        <p>You may be wondering what makes me qualified to reccomend tips and tricks and give advice. I'm currently
            pursuing an Event Management major at Utah Valley University. I have always been the planner in my friend
            group, and have taken the liberty to also get my parents involved in many of my ideas and events. Over the
            last couple of years I have hosted many surprise birthday parties, regular "known about" birthday parties,
            girls nights, and more. I've also recently helped plan a city event with one of my classes, and volunteered
            at my school as well as other community events. I'm always looking for the next thing to plan and be
            involved in!</p>
        <h2>Is it really worth it to be the host?</h2>
        <p>Sometimes the most stressful part is planning, and sometimes it when your guests actually arrive! <em> Being the
            host is one of the most rewarding roles I've had the privlege to play.</em> There is nothing better than having
            friends, family, and strangers comment on the work you have put into the event. The trick that I have found
            most resourcful is to plan so well that you are able to enjoy your event, rather than run around last minute
            trying to make guests happy and plans fall into place. So yes, it is 100% worth it to be the host, if you
            know how to host right!</p>
