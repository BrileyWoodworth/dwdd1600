        <h1>How To</h1>
        <h4>On this page you will find a list of "How To" items and the things that I find most helpful in each of those
            categories.</h4>
        <h2> <strong>How To:</strong> Make an Invitation</h2>
        <h3>All of the things a good invite should include:</h3>
        <p>Invitations feel like a really easy part of planning an event, but there are a few things that can be easy to
            forget. I've compiled a list of some of the key items to put on your invitation. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name of the event</li>
            <li>Host of the event</li>
            <li>Date (put the day of the week and put the year on printed items)</li>
            <li>Time of your event</li>
            <li>Location of the event</li>
            <li>Pricing (if any)</li>
            <li>RSVP information</li>
            <li>RSVP deadline</li>
            <li>Parking information</li>
            <li>Attire</li>
            <li>Anything else that is relevant and important for your guests to know before they arrive</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>A few other things to note about invitations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Send invitations 2-6 weeks in advance so your guests have plenty of notice.</li>
            <li>Send reminders as the event gets closer, especially if you sent invitations early.</li>
            <li>Consider a save-the-date for bigger events—these usually go out 9 weeks to 6 months ahead!</li>
            <li>Use digital reminders—texts, emails, or social media—to confirm RSVPs or share last-minute updates.</li>
            <li>Create a simple event schedule or itinerary so everyone knows what to expect and when.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>How To:</strong> Make a quick and easy event budget</h2>
        <h3>Even with small scale events it's good to set a budget before you get carried away!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Decide on your total budget: Determine the maximum amount you’re willing to spend before you start
                planning.</li>
            <li>List your categories: Common categories include food & drinks, decor, entertainment, invitations, and
                any extra or miscellaneous costs.</li>
            <li>Estimate costs for each category: Do a quick check of prices online or from previous experience to
                assign a realistic amount to each category.</li>
            <li>Prioritize your spending: Decide which categories are most important and where you can cut back if
                needed.</li>
            <li>Track your expenses: Use a simple spreadsheet, notes app, or budgeting template to keep an eye on how
                much you’re spending as you go.</li>
            <li>Adjust as needed: If one category goes over budget, consider scaling back in another category to stay on
                track.</li>
            <li>Review your budget before finalizing: Make sure everything fits within your total budget and you haven’t
                forgotten any important costs.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2><strong>How To:</strong> Create a Menu</h2>
        <h3>Food is often times a key driver to get people to show up, is this something that will be a part of your
            event? If so, here are some things to condsider:</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Food Options</dt>
            <dd>Choose items that fit your event style—finger foods for casual gatherings, themed dishes for special
                occasions, or a potluck to share the work and fun.</dd>

            <dt>Drink Options</dt>
            <dd>Offer a mix of beverages—alcoholic, non-alcoholic, or themed cocktails/mocktails—to suit your guests and
                the vibe of your event.</dd>

            <dt>Dietary Restrictions</dt>
            <dd>Be mindful of allergies or preferences. Consider including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, or other
                options so
                everyone can enjoy the menu.</dd>

            <dt>Serving Style</dt>
            <dd>Decide whether it will be buffet-style, plated, or family-style. Consider what’s easiest for you and
                most enjoyable for your guests.</dd>

            <dt>Presentation & Theme</dt>
            <dd>Match your food and drinks to the theme or color scheme. Small touches like themed napkins, garnish, or
                drink stirrers can make a big impact.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2><strong>How To:</strong> Decorate!</h2>
        <h3>This may be the most fun part of the planning process - but it's easy to get carried away, here are a few
            things to keep in mind when planning your decor!</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Pick a theme or color palette to guide your decorations and make everything feel cohesive.</li>
            <li>Focus on key areas—tables, lighting, and any photo or focal spots that guests will notice most.</li>
            <li>Use small, creative touches to make a big impact without spending a lot, like DIY centerpieces or themed
                napkins.</li>
            <li>Consider the space and layout so guests can move around comfortably and interact with each other.</li>
            <li>Balance style and practicality—fun decorations are great, but don’t let them get in the way of the event
                or your enjoyment as the host.</li>
            <li>Keep some flexibility—sometimes last-minute changes or additions make your decor even more fun and
                memorable!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>How To:</strong> Entertain</h2>
        <h3>This is a broad section that could take up an entire website, but let's talk about a few of the most
            important things to keep in mind:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Plan activities or games that suit your guests and event style.</li>
            <li>Create a playlist or choose music that sets the right mood.</li>
            <li>Consider icebreakers if guests don’t all know each other.</li>
            <li>Think about photo opportunities or small contests to make memories.</li>
            <li>Keep energy levels in mind—mix relaxed moments with fun, interactive parts of the event.</li>
            <li>Have backup activities ready in case something doesn’t go as planned.</li>
            <li>Include interactive elements that encourage guests to mingle and participate.</li>
            <li>Time activities so they don’t overlap with key moments like eating or speeches.</li>
            <li>Consider age ranges and personalities—make sure everyone feels included and comfortable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>How To:</strong> Create a Schedule</h2>
        <h3>Once you have all of your ideas for your event, you now need to plan how you're realistically going to make
            it happen. Scheduling and logistics isn't the fun part but it's necessary!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start with a general timeline: note the start and end times of your event.</li>
            <li>Break the event into sections: arrival, food, activities, entertainment, and wind-down.</li>
            <li>Assign approximate durations for each part, keeping in mind guest attention spans and transitions.</li>
            <li>Include setup and cleanup time so you’re not rushed before or after the event.</li>
            <li>Plan ahead for any DIY projects or prep work—make sure you know how long they will take.</li>
            <li>Consider logistical details: seating, parking, directions, and accessibility for guests.</li>
            <li>Factor in buffer time for unexpected delays or last-minute adjustments.</li>
            <li>Decide on reminders or cues for yourself to keep the event on track (alarms, checklists, etc.).</li>
            <li>Review the schedule to make sure it’s realistic and allows you, as the host, to enjoy the event too.
            </li>
        </ol>
